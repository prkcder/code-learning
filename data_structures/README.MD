### Phase 1: Linear Data Structures (Foundation)

- **arrays** 
  - Static arrays, dynamic arrays, multi-dimensional arrays
  - Foundation for all other data structures
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

- **linked_lists** 
  - Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists
  - Pointer manipulation and memory management
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 2: Stack & Queue Structures (LIFO/FIFO)

- **stacks** 
  - Array-based and linked-list implementations
  - Applications: function calls, expression evaluation, undo operations
  - Time to master: 1 week

- **queues** 
  - Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue, deque
  - Applications: BFS, scheduling, buffering
  - Time to master: 1 week

### Phase 3: Tree Structures (Hierarchical)

- **trees** 
  - Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, Red-Black trees
  - Tree traversals, balancing, searching
  - Time to master: 2-3 weeks

- **heaps** 
  - Min-heap, max-heap, binary heap implementation
  - Applications: priority queues, heap sort, top-K problems
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 4: Hash-Based Structures (Fast Access)

- **hash_tables** 
  - Hash functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing)
  - Load factor, resizing, performance analysis
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 5: Graph Structures (Complex Relationships)

- **graphs** 
  - Adjacency matrix, adjacency list, edge list representations
  - Directed vs undirected, weighted vs unweighted
  - Time to master: 2-3 weeks


### Phase 6: String-Specialized Structures

- **tries** 
  - Prefix trees for efficient string storage and searching
  - Applications: auto-complete, spell checkers, IP routing
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 7: Set Operations

- **sets** 
  - Set ADT implementation, Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
  - Applications: connected components, cycle detection, Kruskal's algorithm
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 8: Advanced Structures (Optional)

- **segment_trees** 
  - Range query optimization for arrays
  - Applications: range sum/min/max queries with updates
  - Time to master: 2-3 weeks

- **fenwick_trees** 
  - Binary Indexed Trees for prefix operations
  - More space-efficient than segment trees
  - Time to master: 1-2 weeks


## Priority Recommendations

- ðŸš¨ **Must Add (Interview Essential)**
  - `tries/` - Very common in string-related interview problems
  - `sets/` - Union-Find is crucial for graph algorithm problems

- ðŸ”§ **Optional (Competitive Programming)**
  - `segment_trees/` - Only if doing competitive programming
  - `fenwick_trees/` - Advanced optimization technique

## Learning Strategy

**For Each Data Structure:**
1. Understand the concept - What problem does it solve?
2. Implement from scratch - Don't just use built-in versions
3. Learn time/space complexity - For all operations
4. Practice problems - 5-10 problems using each structure
5. Compare with alternatives - When to use each one

**Study Schedule:**
- Week 1-2: Arrays + Linked Lists
- Week 3-4: Stacks + Queues
- Week 5-7: Trees + Heaps
- Week 8-9: Hash Tables + Graphs
- Week 10-11: Tries + Sets
- Week 12+: Advanced structures (if needed)


- Ready to start - Begin with arrays and follow the order
