Phase 1: Foundation (Essential)

Linear Search 
Binary Search
Hash Table Search (using dictionaries)

Phase 2: Tree-Based Search

Binary Search Tree (BST) Search
Depth-First Search (DFS) - recursive tree traversal
Breadth-First Search (BFS) - using queue

Phase 3: Advanced Binary Search Variations

Binary Search Variations - find first/last occurrence, insert position
Jump Search - square root jumping
Interpolation Search - for uniformly distributed data
Exponential Search - for unbounded arrays

Phase 4: String Search

Naive String Search - basic pattern matching
KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) - efficient string matching

Phase 5: Graph Search

DFS on Graphs - adjacency list/matrix
BFS on Graphs - shortest path in unweighted graphs

Phase 6: Optimizations & Specialized

Ternary Search - divide into 3 parts
Fibonacci Search - using Fibonacci numbers
Sentinel Linear Search - optimized linear search

Why This Order?
Phase 1 - Core Foundation

Binary Search: Most important algorithm, teaches divide-and-conquer
Hash Search: O(1) average case, uses Python dictionaries

Phase 2 - Tree Concepts

BST: Combines binary search with tree structure
DFS/BFS: Fundamental graph traversal, used everywhere

Phase 3 - Binary Search Mastery

Variations teach you to handle edge cases and modifications
Jump/Interpolation/Exponential build on binary search concepts

Phase 4 - String Processing

Essential for text processing and pattern matching
KMP is advanced but very powerful

Phase 5 - Graph Applications

Applies DFS/BFS to more complex data structures
Real-world applications

Phase 6 - Polish & Optimize

Advanced techniques and optimizations
Less common but good to know

Learning Tips

Master each phase before moving to the next
Implement from scratch - don't just copy code
Test with edge cases - empty arrays, single elements, not found
Analyze time/space complexity for each algorithm
Compare performance - when would you use each one?

Focus Areas by Phase

Phase 1-2: Master these completely (interview essentials)
Phase 3-4: Important for advanced interviews
Phase 5-6: Nice to have, shows depth of knowledge
